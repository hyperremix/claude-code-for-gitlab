This project enables Claude to respond to mentions in GitLab comments, implement code changes, and provide intelligent code assistance directly within your GitLab workflow.

## Key Features

- ü§ñ **Interactive Code Assistant**: Claude can answer questions about code, architecture, and programming
- üîç **Code Review**: Analyzes MR changes and suggests improvements
- ‚ú® **Code Implementation**: Can implement simple fixes, refactoring, and even new features
- üí¨ **MR/Issue Integration**: Works seamlessly with GitLab comments and merge request reviews
- üõ†Ô∏è **Flexible Tool Access**: Access to GitLab APIs and file operations
- üìã **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates in GitLab comments as Claude completes tasks
- üèÉ **Runs on Your Infrastructure**: Executes entirely in your GitLab runners
- üè¢ **Enterprise Ready**: Full support for self-hosted GitLab instances with custom domains

## GitLab Quick Start

### Step 1: Deploy Webhook Service

Deploy the webhook service for real-time responses to GitLab mentions:

```bash
# Using Docker
docker run -d \
  --name gitlab-claude-webhook \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e GITLAB_TOKEN=glpat-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \
  -e WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret-here \
  -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY \
  ghcr.io/hyperremix/claude-code-gitlab-app:latest
```

Then configure webhooks in your GitLab project settings. See the [GitLab App Setup Guide](./docs/GITLAB_APP_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

### Step 2: Configure GitLab CI/CD

Add to your `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
include:
  - remote: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperremix/claude-code-for-gitlab/main/gitlab-claude-unified.yml"

variables:
  CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN: $CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN
  # Or use: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

**Requirements**:

- GitLab Runner with Docker executor
- Claude authentication (API key or OAuth token)
- Developer or higher permissions in the GitLab project

## Detailed Setup Instructions

### Setting Up GitLab Variables

1. **Navigate to your GitLab project**
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **CI/CD** ‚Üí **Variables**
3. Add the following variables:
   - `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`: Your Claude OAuth token (Pro/Max users can generate this by running `claude setup-token` locally)
   - OR `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Your Anthropic API key
   - `CLAUDE_CODE_GL_ACCESS_TOKEN`: GitLab personal access token with `api` scope (for posting comments)

### Webhook Service Configuration

For the webhook service, you'll also need:

- `GITLAB_TOKEN`: Personal access token with `api` scope
- `WEBHOOK_SECRET`: A random secret for webhook validation
- `GITLAB_URL`: Your GitLab instance URL (defaults to <https://gitlab.com>)

See the [GitLab App Setup Guide](./docs/GITLAB_APP_SETUP.md) for complete setup instructions including:

- Creating GitLab OAuth applications
- Configuring webhooks
- Setting up for self-hosted GitLab instances
- Docker deployment options

## Examples

### Ways to Tag @claude

These examples show how to interact with Claude using comments in MRs and issues. By default, Claude will be triggered anytime you mention `@claude`, but you can customize the exact trigger phrase using the `trigger_phrase` configuration.

Claude will see the full MR context, including any comments.

#### Ask Questions

Add a comment to an MR or issue:

```
@claude What does this function do and how could we improve it?
```

Claude will analyze the code and provide a detailed explanation with suggestions.

#### Request Fixes

Ask Claude to implement specific changes:

```
@claude Can you add error handling to this function?
```

#### Code Review

Get a thorough review:

```
@claude Please review this MR and suggest improvements
```

Claude will analyze the changes and provide feedback.

#### Fix Bugs from Screenshots

Upload a screenshot of a bug and ask Claude to fix it:

```
@claude Here's a screenshot of a bug I'm seeing [upload screenshot]. Can you fix it?
```

Claude can see and analyze images, making it easy to fix visual bugs or UI issues.

### Custom Automations

These examples show how to configure Claude to act automatically based on GitLab events, without requiring manual @mentions.

#### Automated Documentation Updates

Automatically update documentation when specific files change:

```yaml
variables:
  DIRECT_PROMPT: |
    Update the API documentation in README.md to reflect
    the changes made to the API endpoints in this MR.

rules:
  - if: '$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"'
    changes:
      - "src/api/**/*.ts"
```

When API files are modified, Claude automatically updates your README with the latest endpoint documentation and pushes the changes back to the MR.

#### Author-Specific Code Reviews

Automatically review MRs from specific authors or external contributors:

```yaml
variables:
  DIRECT_PROMPT: |
    Please provide a thorough review of this merge request.
    Pay extra attention to coding standards, security practices,
    and test coverage since this is from an external contributor.

rules:
  - if: "$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_PROJECT_ID != $CI_PROJECT_ID"
```

Perfect for automatically reviewing MRs from external contributors or when you need extra guidance.

#### Custom Prompt Templates

Use `override_prompt` for complete control over Claude's behavior with variable substitution:

```yaml
variables:
  OVERRIDE_PROMPT: |
    Analyze MR !$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID in $CI_PROJECT_PATH for security vulnerabilities.

    Changed files:
    $CHANGED_FILES

    Focus on:
    - SQL injection risks
    - XSS vulnerabilities
    - Authentication bypasses
    - Exposed secrets or credentials

    Provide severity ratings (Critical/High/Medium/Low) for any issues found.
```

## How It Works

1. **Trigger Detection**: Listens for comments containing the trigger phrase (default: `@claude`) or issue assignment to a specific user
2. **Context Gathering**: Analyzes the MR/issue, comments, code changes
3. **Smart Responses**: Either answers questions or implements changes
4. **Branch Management**: Creates new MRs for human authors, pushes directly for Claude's own MRs
5. **Communication**: Posts updates at every step to keep you informed

## Capabilities and Limitations

### What Claude Can Do

- **Respond in a Single Comment**: Claude operates by updating a single initial comment with progress and results
- **Answer Questions**: Analyze code and provide explanations
- **Implement Code Changes**: Make simple to moderate code changes based on requests
- **Prepare Merge Requests**: Creates commits on a branch and links back to a prefilled MR creation page
- **Perform Code Reviews**: Analyze MR changes and provide detailed feedback
- **Smart Branch Handling**:
  - When triggered on an **issue**: Always creates a new branch for the work
  - When triggered on an **open MR**: Always pushes directly to the existing MR branch
  - When triggered on a **closed MR**: Creates a new branch since the original is no longer active

### What Claude Cannot Do

- **Submit MR Reviews**: Claude cannot submit formal GitLab MR reviews
- **Approve MRs**: For security reasons, Claude cannot approve merge requests
- **Post Multiple Comments**: Claude only acts by updating its initial comment
- **Execute Commands Outside Its Context**: Claude only has access to the repository and MR/issue context it's triggered in
- **Run Arbitrary Bash Commands**: By default, Claude cannot execute Bash commands unless explicitly allowed using the `allowed_tools` configuration
- **Perform Branch Operations**: Cannot merge branches, rebase, or perform other git operations beyond pushing commits

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Environment Variables

You can pass custom environment variables to Claude Code execution using the `claude_env` configuration:

```yaml
variables:
  CLAUDE_ENV: |
    NODE_ENV: test
    CI: true
    DATABASE_URL: postgres://test:test@localhost:5432/test_db
```

The `claude_env` input accepts YAML format where each line defines a key-value pair. These environment variables will be available to Claude Code during execution.

### Limiting Conversation Turns

You can use the `max_turns` parameter to limit the number of back-and-forth exchanges Claude can have during task execution:

```yaml
variables:
  MAX_TURNS: "5" # Limit to 5 conversation turns
```

When the turn limit is reached, Claude will stop execution gracefully.

### Custom Tools

By default, Claude only has access to:

- File operations (reading, committing, editing files, read-only git commands)
- Comment management (creating/updating comments)
- Basic GitLab operations

Claude does **not** have access to execute arbitrary Bash commands by default. If you want Claude to run specific commands (e.g., npm install, npm test), you must explicitly allow them using the `allowed_tools` configuration:

```yaml
variables:
  ALLOWED_TOOLS: |
    Bash(npm install)
    Bash(npm run test)
    Edit
    Replace
  DISALLOWED_TOOLS: |
    TaskOutput
    KillTask
```

### Custom Model

Use a specific Claude model:

```yaml
variables:
  MODEL: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
```

### Network Restrictions

For enhanced security, you can restrict Claude's network access to specific domains only:

```yaml
variables:
  EXPERIMENTAL_ALLOWED_DOMAINS: |
    .anthropic.com
    .gitlab.com
    .gitlab.company.com
```

### Claude Code Settings

You can provide Claude Code settings to customize behavior such as model selection, environment variables, permissions, and hooks:

```yaml
variables:
  SETTINGS: |
    {
      "model": "claude-opus-4-20250514",
      "env": {
        "DEBUG": "true",
        "API_URL": "https://api.example.com"
      },
      "permissions": {
        "allow": ["Bash", "Read"],
        "deny": ["WebFetch"]
      }
    }
```

## Cloud Providers

You can authenticate with Claude using any of these three methods:

1. Direct Anthropic API (default)
2. Amazon Bedrock with OIDC authentication
3. Google Vertex AI with OIDC authentication

### Model Configuration

Use provider-specific model names based on your chosen provider:

```yaml
# For direct Anthropic API (default)
variables:
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# For Amazon Bedrock
variables:
  MODEL: "anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-beta:0"
  USE_BEDROCK: "true"

# For Google Vertex AI
variables:
  MODEL: "claude-3-7-sonnet@20250219"
  USE_VERTEX: "true"
```

## Security

### Access Control

- **Repository Access**: The action can only be triggered by users with developer access or higher to the GitLab project
- **Token Permissions**: The GitLab token receives only the necessary permissions scoped specifically to the project it's operating in
- **No Cross-Repository Access**: Each action invocation is limited to the repository where it was triggered
- **Limited Scope**: The token cannot access other repositories or perform actions beyond the configured permissions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Authentication Protection

**CRITICAL: Never hardcode your Anthropic API key or OAuth token in GitLab CI files!**

Your authentication credentials must always be stored in GitLab CI/CD variables to prevent unauthorized access:

```yaml
# CORRECT ‚úÖ
variables:
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
  # OR
  CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN: $CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN

# NEVER DO THIS ‚ùå
variables:
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: "sk-ant-api03-..." # Exposed and vulnerable!
```

### Setting Up GitLab CI/CD Variables

1. Go to your GitLab project's Settings
2. Click on "CI/CD"
3. Expand "Variables"
4. Click "Add variable"
5. For authentication, choose one:
   - API Key: Key: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, Value: Your Anthropic API key (starting with `sk-ant-`)
   - OAuth Token: Key: `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, Value: Your Claude Code OAuth token
6. Make sure to mark the variable as "Protected" and "Masked" for security
7. Click "Add variable"

### Best Practices for Authentication

1. ‚úÖ Always use `$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `$CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` in CI files
2. ‚úÖ Never commit API keys or tokens to version control
3. ‚úÖ Regularly rotate your API keys and tokens
4. ‚úÖ Use group-level variables for organization-wide access
5. ‚ùå Never share API keys or tokens in merge requests or issues
6. ‚ùå Avoid logging variables that might contain keys
