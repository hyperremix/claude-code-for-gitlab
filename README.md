# ü¶ä Claude Code for GitLab

A GitLab-specific implementation of [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) that brings AI-powered assistance to GitLab merge requests and issues through a **webhook-only architecture**. This project enables Claude to respond to mentions in GitLab comments, implement code changes, and provide intelligent code assistance directly within your GitLab workflow.

## Key Features

- ü§ñ **Interactive Code Assistant**: Claude can answer questions about code, architecture, and programming
- üîç **Code Review**: Analyzes MR changes and suggests improvements
- ‚ú® **Code Implementation**: Can implement simple fixes, refactoring, and even new features
- üí¨ **MR/Issue Integration**: Works seamlessly with GitLab comments and merge request reviews
- üõ†Ô∏è **Webhook-Driven**: Reliable webhook server architecture for real-time responses
- üìã **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates in GitLab comments as Claude completes tasks
- üèÉ **Runs on Your Infrastructure**: Executes entirely in your GitLab runners
- üè¢ **Enterprise Ready**: Full support for self-hosted GitLab instances with custom domains

## Architecture Overview

Claude Code for GitLab uses a **webhook-only architecture** that provides:

- **Simplified Setup** - Single webhook server handles all GitLab integration
- **Reliable Triggering** - Direct webhook events ensure consistent operation
- **Rate Limiting** - Built-in rate limiting (3 triggers per user per resource per 15 minutes)
- **Branch Management** - Automatic branch creation for issues
- **Pipeline Management** - Cancels old pipelines and starts new ones
- **Discord Integration** - Optional Discord notifications for results

## How It Works

1. **Webhook Trigger**: User mentions @claude in GitLab issue/MR comment
2. **Server Processing**: Webhook server validates, creates branches, and triggers pipeline
3. **Pipeline Execution**: GitLab CI/CD runs Claude Code with provided context
4. **Result Handling**: Claude's output is posted back to GitLab

## Configuration

## Capabilities and Limitations

### What Claude Can Do

- **Answer Questions**: Analyze code and provide explanations
- **Implement Code Changes**: Make simple to moderate code changes based on requests
- **Create Merge Requests**: Creates commits on a branch and links back to a prefilled MR creation page
- **Perform Code Reviews**: Analyze MR changes and provide detailed feedback
- **Smart Branch Handling**: Automatically creates branches for issues, uses existing MR branches
- **Progress Tracking**: Updates a single comment with progress and results

### What Claude Cannot Do

- **Submit MR Reviews**: Claude cannot submit formal GitLab MR reviews (security restriction)
- **Approve MRs**: For security reasons, Claude cannot approve merge requests
- **Execute Arbitrary Commands**: Cannot run bash commands unless explicitly allowed
- **Cross-Repository Access**: Limited to the specific repository where triggered

For detailed capabilities and troubleshooting, see the [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## Security

### Access Control and Best Practices

- **Repository Access**: Only users with Developer+ access can trigger Claude
- **Token Permissions**: GitLab tokens use minimal required scopes
- **Webhook Validation**: HMAC signatures validate all webhook requests
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against abuse (configurable)

### üîí Critical Security Guidelines

**Never hardcode API keys or tokens in GitLab CI files!** Always use GitLab CI/CD variables:

```yaml
# CORRECT ‚úÖ
variables:
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
  CLAUDE_CODE_GL_ACCESS_TOKEN: $CLAUDE_CODE_GL_ACCESS_TOKEN

# NEVER DO THIS ‚ùå
variables:
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: "sk-ant-api03-..." # Exposed and vulnerable!
```

For comprehensive security guidelines, see the [Authentication Guide](docs/AUTHENTICATION_GUIDE.md).

## Cloud Provider Support

Claude Code supports multiple authentication methods:

- **Direct Anthropic API** (default) - Use your Anthropic API key
- **Amazon Bedrock** - OIDC authentication with AWS
- **Google Vertex AI** - OIDC authentication with Google Cloud

For setup instructions, see the [Authentication Guide](docs/AUTHENTICATION_GUIDE.md).
