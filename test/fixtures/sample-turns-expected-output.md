I'll help you with this task. Let me start by examining the file to understand what needs to be changed.

### ðŸ”§ `Read`

**Parameters:**
```json
{
  "file_path": "/path/to/sample/file.py"
}
```

**Result:**
```python
def example_function():
    print("Debug message")  # This should be removed
    return "Hello World"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = example_function()
    print(result)
```

I can see the debug print statement that needs to be removed. Let me fix this by editing the file.

### ðŸ”§ `Edit`

**Parameters:**
```json
{
  "file_path": "/path/to/sample/file.py",
  "old_string": "def example_function():\n    print(\"Debug message\")  # This should be removed\n    return \"Hello World\"",
  "new_string": "def example_function():\n    return \"Hello World\""
}
```

**â†’** File successfully edited. The debug print statement has been removed.
