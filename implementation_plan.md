# Implementation Plan

## [Overview]

Comprehensively optimize the GitHub Actions CI workflow through dependency caching, job restructuring, and workflow efficiency improvements.

The current .github/workflows/ci.yml has three independent jobs (test, prettier, typecheck) that each separately install dependencies using `bun install`. This creates inefficiencies through repeated downloads, installations, and lack of parallelization optimization. The comprehensive improvement will introduce dependency caching, restructure jobs with proper dependencies, standardize bun versions, and optimize the overall workflow architecture to significantly reduce CI execution time and improve reliability.

## [Types]

No new type definitions required for this workflow optimization.

This change only involves GitHub Actions workflow configuration and does not require modifications to TypeScript interfaces, enums, or data structures. The existing types in the codebase remain unchanged.

## [Files]

Comprehensive restructuring of workflow configuration with dependency optimization.

### Files to be modified

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Complete optimization including job restructuring, dependency caching, and workflow efficiency improvements

### Workflow restructuring

- Create a `setup` job as prerequisite for dependency installation and caching
- Restructure `test`, `prettier`, and `typecheck` jobs to depend on `setup` job
- Add dependency matrix for parallel execution where appropriate
- Implement proper job dependencies and artifacts sharing

### Configuration changes

- Add GitHub Actions cache configuration for bun dependencies
- Standardize bun version to v2 (1.2.12) across all jobs
- Add cache key based on bun.lock file hash
- Configure cache paths for bun's global cache directory
- Optimize job parallelization and dependency management
- Add workflow artifacts for sharing build outputs between jobs

## [Functions]  

No function modifications required for workflow optimization.

This implementation only involves GitHub Actions workflow configuration and does not require changes to any TypeScript functions, methods, or executable code. All existing functions in the codebase remain unchanged.

## [Classes]

No class modifications required for workflow optimization.

This implementation only involves GitHub Actions workflow configuration and does not require changes to any TypeScript classes, their methods, inheritance, or structure. All existing classes in the codebase remain unchanged.

## [Dependencies]

Standardization of existing build tool versions without adding new packages.

### Build tool standardization

- Standardize all jobs to use `oven-sh/setup-bun@v2` action
- Set consistent bun version to `1.2.12` across all jobs (currently test and typecheck use v2 with 1.2.12, prettier uses v1 with latest)
- No new package dependencies added to package.json or gitlab-app/package.json

### Caching dependencies

- Utilize GitHub Actions built-in caching mechanism
- Cache bun's global dependency store
- No external caching services or tools required

## [Testing]

Verification of workflow optimization through CI execution testing.

### Testing approach

- Trigger CI workflow execution to verify caching works correctly
- Ensure all three jobs (test, prettier, typecheck) still pass with caching enabled
- Verify dependency installation time is reduced on subsequent runs
- Confirm cache hits are working properly by checking workflow logs

### Validation criteria

- First workflow run shows cache miss and creates cache
- Subsequent runs show cache hit and faster dependency installation
- All existing tests continue to pass
- No regression in functionality of any CI jobs

## [Implementation Order]

Comprehensive workflow restructuring with progressive optimization to minimize conflicts and ensure successful implementation.

1. **Create Setup Job**: Implement a new `setup` job that handles dependency installation, caching, and preparation of shared artifacts
2. **Restructure Existing Jobs**: Modify `test`, `prettier`, and `typecheck` jobs to depend on the `setup` job and use cached dependencies
3. **Standardize Bun Setup Actions**: Update all jobs to use consistent bun version (v2 with 1.2.12) and setup configuration
4. **Implement Dependency Caching**: Add GitHub Actions cache for bun dependencies with appropriate cache keys based on bun.lock hash
5. **Optimize Job Dependencies**: Configure proper job dependencies to enable parallelization while ensuring setup completion
6. **Add Artifacts Management**: Implement workflow artifacts for sharing build outputs and dependencies between jobs
7. **Test Workflow Execution**: Verify the restructured workflow executes correctly with proper caching and job dependencies
8. **Validate Performance Improvements**: Confirm significant reduction in CI execution time and improved resource utilization
